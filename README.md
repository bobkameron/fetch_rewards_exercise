Fetch Rewards Points

This project allows someone to add points, spend points, and retrieve the balance of their points associated with a payer. The project uses the Django framework. To run the project, please install Django by entering into the command line:

python -m pip install Django 

Then, go into the mysite directory, and you can run the following command to start the web service:

python manage.py runserver

The default port is 8000; you can change this in mysite/mysite/settings.py. 

You can access the admin page of the website at 

http://localhost:8000/admin/

The administrator login info is:
username: admin
password: Letuserin

Here, you can manage payers and transactions.

To run the unit tests, simply run  the command python manage.py test

The tests for this app can be found inside mysite/points/tests.py 
Feel free to add any further tests of your choosing. 

All transactions are recorded in a durable data store (SQLite database). 


API SPECIFICATION:

The following is an API specification for the project- 

Once you start running the server, you can make HTTP API requests with curl or another
utility of your choosing. The PUT and DELETE requests only accept requests where the body of the 
request is in JSON format.

The specification is in the format:  URL request-method, 
where the request must be made to http://host:host_port/URL with the method request-method.

points/ GET 

Any HTTP GET request simply returns a JSON object in an HTTP response body 
that specifies the remaining balance for every payer that ever added 
a valid transaction. The JSON response is in the format:

{ "company_name": points1 , "company_name2":points2 ,  etc.  }

mapping strings of payer names (company_name) with the number of points (a non-negative integer) 
left in the payer balance. 

HTTP status code of 200 is returned along with the HTTP response. 


points/ PUT 

A valid HTTP PUT request simply adds transactions for a specific payer and date. It should have the 'Content-Type' header set to 'application/json',
and the body of the request should be a single JSON object in the format:

{ "payer": company_name , "points": points , "timestamp": iso_datetime }

where company_name is a string referring to the unique UTF-8 case-sensitive name of the payer that the 
transaction should record, points is a non-zero integer, and iso_datetime should be a string in the format
"YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ" specifying the Year, month, day, hour, minute, second, and timezone that the 
transaction should be recorded. 

The string company_name should have at least one non whitespace character. Any leading or trailing
whitespace is stripped when the transaction is recorded, so "Dannon" is the same as " Dannon   ". However, this API is case-sensitive, so recording a transaction for the payer "DANNON" is different from one added for "dannon". 

Only non-zero points are allowed to be recorded in a transaction (value mapped to points can be negative or positive but not 0). Also, the payer's points must never go negative; the sum of all the previous transactions associated with the payer - points spent from payer's account + current transaction cannot be less than 0. 

Any valid HTTP JSON PUT request following the above specification will successfully add the transaction by adding the number of points specified at a timestamp associated with the payer, and return an HTTP response with status code 201. Otherwise, an HTTP response with error status code 4xx is returned indicating failure to add the transaction. 


points/ DELETE

A valid HTTP DELETE request simply spends points. The 'Content-Type' header should be set to 'application/json', and the body of the request should be a single JSON object in the format:

{ "points": points }

Here, points should be a non-negative integer indicating the number of points that the user wants to spend. The number of points that the user wants to spend must be less than or equal to the total number of points that the user has left in their balance. 

If the HTTP DELETE request follows the above specifications, then the points are spent in a manner where the oldest points are spent first (oldest based on transaction timestamp, not the order theyâ€™re received). An HTTP response of status code 201 is returned (200 if no points were spent if the client sends in a request of '{"points":0}' requesting no points to be spent ), and the body of the response is in the following format:

[
{ "payer": company_name1 , "points": points1 },
{ "payer": company_name2 , "points": points2 },
    ...
]

which simply indicates the net change in the number of points associated with each payer for any payer that had a transaction that was spent in full or partially. 

An invalid HTTP DELETE request returns an HTTP response with status code 4xx indicating failure to spend any points.
